# 🥗 NutriPlan AI  
An Intelligent Multi-Agent Nutrition Assistant Powered by Google ADK & Gemini

NutriPlan AI is a fully featured **multi-agent system** designed to generate safe, personalized daily meal plans, compute macronutrients, and retrieve real-world nutrition facts via search.  
It demonstrates practical use of **LLM‑powered agents**, **sequential workflows**, **custom tools**, **memory reasoning**, **observability**, and **automated evaluation**—all key concepts taught in the Google ADK course.

I personally built this project because I often struggle with the everyday question:  
**“What should I eat today?”**  
NutriPlan AI answers that question with structure, safety, and intelligence.

# 🧠 Project Overview

NutriPlan AI is an intelligent, multi-agent nutrition assistant that helps users:

✓ Generate a **personalized 1‑day meal plan**  
✓ Calculate **recommended macros** based on calorie targets  
✓ Retrieve **nutrition facts** using real Google Search  
✓ Maintain lightweight memory during the conversation  
✓ Enforce **health safety guardrails** for extreme calorie values  
✓ Provide observability through logging and evaluation tooling  

The system is built to be:

- **Modular** — each agent handles one responsibility  
- **Safe** — strict calorie guardrails prevent harmful recommendations  
- **Intuitive** — detects greetings, help requests, farewells, nutrition queries, and plan requests  
- **Extensible** — additional tools or agents can be plugged in seamlessly

# 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nutriplan-ai.git
cd nutriplan-ai
```

Create (optional) a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install Google ADK with all extras:

```bash
pip install "google-adk[all]"
```

---

# ▶️ Running the Agent

Inside the project folder:

```bash
adk run nutri
```

This launches your full NutriPlan AI assistant.

---

# 🏗️ Project Architecture

NutriPlan AI is built using a **root router agent** that delegates every user message to the appropriate sub-agent:

```
User → Root Agent → {Greeting, Help, Preprocess, Meal Planner, Nutrition Search, Farewell}
```

### High-Level Flow

1. **GreetingAgent** — triggers on simple greetings  
2. **HelpAgent** — explains capabilities  
3. **FarewellAgent** — exits politely  
4. **NutritionSearchAgent** — answers nutrition fact questions  
5. **NutritionFlowGroup (SequentialAgent)**  
   - **NutritionPreprocessAgent** collects:
     - daily_calories  
     - dietary_preferences  
   - **NutritionistPlannerAgent** generates macros + meal plan  
6. **Router chooses EXACTLY ONE agent per turn**  

This ensures clarity, determinism, and removes ambiguity.

# 🤖 Multi-Agent Design

NutriPlan AI demonstrates three key ADK concepts:

### ✔️ LLM-Powered Agents
All agents run on **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, each with different instructions.

### ✔️ Sequential Agents
`NutritionFlowGroup` chains:

1. Preprocessing  
2. Planning

Ensuring the meal plan is only produced when all inputs are known.

### ✔️ Custom Router Logic
The root agent uses explicit tool-selection rules to determine flow.

---

# 🔧 Tooling

NutriPlan AI uses **two categories of tools**:

## 1. Custom Python Tool
A handcrafted macro calculator:

```python
def calculate_macros(daily_calories: int) -> dict:
    # 30% protein, 40% carbs, 30% fats
    ...
    return {"protein_g": ..., "carbs_g": ..., "fats_g": ...}
```

Used by `NutritionistPlannerAgent` to create the **Recommended Macros** section.

## 2. Built-in ADK Tool: google_search

```python
from google.adk.tools import google_search
```

Used by `NutritionSearchAgent` to answer questions like:

- “How many calories are in an avocado?”
- “Is brown rice higher in fiber than white rice?”

---

# 🧵 Memory & Context Handling

Although ADK’s full session memory tools aren't used here,  
**NutritionPreprocessAgent reads the entire conversation history** to detect:

- previously stated calories  
- previously stated dietary preferences  

This prevents repetitive questions and creates a **lightweight memory layer**.

---

# 🔒 Safety Guardrails

The planner **refuses to generate a meal plan** if:

```
daily_calories < 1000 OR > 5000
```

The agent returns a medical safety warning instead.

This demonstrates safe LLM deployment practices.

---

# 📊 Observability & Logging

The project uses:

### ✔️ Python Logging
```python
logger.info("Calculating macros for daily_calories=%s", daily_calories)
```

### ✔️ ADK Automatic Logs
ADK automatically outputs:

- Tool calls  
- Agent routing  
- LLM responses  
- Execution metadata  

### ▶️ Live Log Monitoring

```bash
tail -F /path/to/agents_log/agent.latest.log
```

---

# 🧪 Evaluation

NutriPlan AI includes a custom eval set:

```
evals/nutriplan_basic_evalset.json
```

Run evaluation:

```bash
adk eval nutri evals/nutriplan_basic_evalset.json > evals/results.json
```

## 📂 Evaluation History

ADK stores results under:

```
nutri/.adk/eval_history/
```

## Metrics Included

- `tool_trajectory_avg_score`
- `response_match_score`
